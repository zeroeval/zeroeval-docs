## Creating a judge (&lt;5 mins)

1. Go to [Monitoring â†’ Judges â†’ New Judge](https://app.zeroeval.com/monitoring/signal-automations).
2. Sepcify the behaviour that you want to track from your production traffic.
3. Tweak the prompt of the judge until it matches what you are looking for!

That's it! Historical and future traces will be scored automatically and shown in the dashboard.
