---

The LLM Gateway is a unified API that lets you access multiple Large Language Models through a single endpoint. Switch between models from different providers with just a parameter change.

## Getting Started

### 1. Get Your API Key

Create an API key from your [Settings â†’ API Keys](https://app.zeroeval.com/settings?section=api-keys) page.

### 2. Use the API

Replace your OpenAI base URL with ZeroEval's gateway and use model names directly:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize the client with ZeroEval API
client = OpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://api.zeroeval.com/v1",
)

# Make a completion request
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o", # Just the model name, no provider prefix
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"},
    ],
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)

````

```typescript TypeScript
import OpenAI from 'openai';

// Initialize the client with ZeroEval API
const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  baseURL: 'https://api.zeroeval.com/v1',
});

// Make a completion request
async function generateResponse() {
  const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4o', // Just the model name, no provider prefix
    messages: [
      { role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant.' },
      { role: 'user', content: 'Hello, how are you?' },
    ],
  });

  console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
}

generateResponse();
````

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.zeroeval.com/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Hello, how are you?"
      }
    ]
  }'
```
