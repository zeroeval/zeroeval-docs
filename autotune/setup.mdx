# Setup

To start using autotune, you need to instrument your code with ZeroEval. The setup is simple and requires just two steps:

## 1. Initialize ZeroEval

First, initialize ZeroEval in your application:

```python
import zeroeval as ze

ze.init()
```

## 2. Use managed prompts with ze.get_prompt()

For LLM calls you want to tune, fetch your managed prompt and associate it with the task using `task_name`:

```python
system_message = {
    "role": "system",
    "content": ze.get_prompt(
        "custom-bot-5",
        variables={
            "task": "coding questions",
            "tone": "helpful and concise"
        },
        task_name="custom-bot-5"
    ).content
}
```

## Key Points

- **Name your prompts**: Each prompt needs a unique `slug` (task name) for tracking and tuning
- **Use variables**: Define variables with `{{variable_name}}` syntax in your prompt content
- **Automatic interpolation**: Variables inside `{{}}` are automatically interpolated with their values and don't add anything to your context
- **Automatic tracking**: ZeroEval will automatically track conversations and performance
- **No additional changes needed**: Your existing LLM calls work as-is once the prompt is wrapped

That's it! ZeroEval will now automatically track your conversations and enable autotune capabilities.

When you're ready to tune your prompts, you can use the [Tuning UI](/autotune/tuning) to create a tuning task.
