# Setup

To start using autotune, you need to instrument your code with ZeroEval. The setup is simple and requires just two steps:

## 1. Initialize ZeroEval

First, initialize ZeroEval in your application:

```python
import zeroeval as ze

ze.init()
```

## 2. Wrap System Prompts with ze.prompt()

For any LLM calls you want to tune, wrap your system prompts with `ze.prompt()`:

```python
system_message = {
    "role": "system",
    "content": ze.prompt(
        name="custom-bot-5",
        content="You are an assistant that helps users with {{task}}. Be {{tone}} in your responses.",
        variables={
            "task": "coding questions",
            "tone": "helpful and concise"
        }
    )
}
```

## Key Points

- **Name your prompts**: Each prompt needs a unique `name` for tracking and tuning
- **Use variables**: Define variables with `{{variable_name}}` syntax in your prompt content
- **Automatic interpolation**: Variables inside `{{}}` are automatically interpolated with their values and don't add anything to your context
- **Automatic tracking**: ZeroEval will automatically track conversations and performance
- **No additional changes needed**: Your existing LLM calls work as-is once the prompt is wrapped

That's it! ZeroEval will now automatically track your conversations and enable autotune capabilities.

When you're ready to tune your prompts, you can use the [Tuning UI](/autotune/tuning) to create a tuning task.
