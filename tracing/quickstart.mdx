description: Get started with tracing and observability in ZeroEval
---

ZeroEval provides comprehensive tracing capabilities to help you monitor, debug, and optimize your AI applications. This guide introduces the core concepts and helps you get started.

Tracing allows you to monitor and debug your AI applications by capturing detailed information about each operation:

- **Spans**: Individual units of work (e.g., an API call, a function execution)
- **Traces**: Complete request flows composed of multiple spans
- **Sessions**: Groups of related traces (e.g., a user conversation)
- **Attributes**: Metadata attached to spans for filtering and analysis

## Getting Started
