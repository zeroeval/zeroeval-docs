Calibrated LLM judges are AI evaluators that watch your traces, sessions, or spans and score outputs according to criteria you define. They get better over time the more you refine and correct their evaluations.

## When to use

Use a judge when you want consistent, scalable evaluation of:

- Hallucinations, safety/policy violations
- Response quality (helpfulness, tone, structure)
- Latency, cost, and error patterns tied to specific criteria
