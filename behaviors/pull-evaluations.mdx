title: "Pulling Evaluations"
description: "Retrieve judge evaluations via SDK or REST API"
---

Retrieve judge evaluations programmatically for reporting, analysis, or integration into your own workflows.

## Finding your IDs

Before making API calls, you'll need these identifiers:

| ID | Where to find it |
|---|---|
| **Project ID** | Settings → Project, or in any URL after `/projects/` |
| **Judge ID** | Click a judge in the dashboard; the ID is in the URL (`/judges/{judge_id}`) |
| **Span ID** | In trace details, or returned by your instrumentation code |

## Python SDK

### Get evaluations by judge

Fetch all evaluations for a specific judge with pagination and optional filters.

```python
import zeroeval as ze

ze.init(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

response = ze.get_behavior_evaluations(
    project_id="your-project-id",
    judge_id="your-judge-id",
    limit=100,
    offset=0,
)

print(f"Total: {response['total']}")
for eval in response["evaluations"]:
    print(f"Span: {eval['span_id']}")
    print(f"Result: {'PASS' if eval['evaluation_result'] else 'FAIL'}")
    print(f"Score: {eval.get('score')}")  # For scored judges
    print(f"Reason: {eval['evaluation_reason']}")
```

**Optional filters:**

```python
response = ze.get_behavior_evaluations(
    project_id="your-project-id",
    judge_id="your-judge-id",
    limit=100,
    offset=0,
    start_date="2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    end_date="2025-01-31T23:59:59Z",
    evaluation_result=True,  # Only passing evaluations
    feedback_state="with_user_feedback",  # Only calibrated items
)
```

### Get evaluations by span

Fetch all judge evaluations for a specific span (useful when a span has been evaluated by multiple judges).

```python
response = ze.get_span_evaluations(
    project_id="your-project-id",
    span_id="your-span-id",
)

for eval in response["evaluations"]:
    print(f"Judge: {eval['judge_name']}")
    print(f"Result: {'PASS' if eval['evaluation_result'] else 'FAIL'}")
    if eval.get('evaluation_type') == 'scored':
        print(f"Score: {eval['score']} / {eval['score_max']}")
```

## REST API

Use these endpoints directly with your API key in the `Authorization` header.

### Get evaluations by judge

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.zeroeval.com/projects/{project_id}/judges/{judge_id}/evaluations?limit=100&offset=0" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ZEROEVAL_API_KEY"
```

**Query parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `limit` | int | Results per page (1-500, default 100) |
| `offset` | int | Pagination offset (default 0) |
| `start_date` | string | Filter by date (ISO 8601) |
| `end_date` | string | Filter by date (ISO 8601) |
| `evaluation_result` | bool | `true` for passing, `false` for failing |
| `feedback_state` | string | `with_user_feedback` or `without_user_feedback` |

### Get evaluations by span

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.zeroeval.com/projects/{project_id}/spans/{span_id}/evaluations" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ZEROEVAL_API_KEY"
```

## Response format

### Judge evaluations response

```json
{
  "evaluations": [...],
  "total": 142,
  "limit": 100,
  "offset": 0
}
```

### Span evaluations response

```json
{
  "span_id": "abc-123",
  "evaluations": [...]
}
```

### Evaluation object

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Unique evaluation ID |
| `span_id` | string | The evaluated span |
| `evaluation_result` | bool | Pass (`true`) or fail (`false`) |
| `evaluation_reason` | string | Judge's reasoning |
| `confidence_score` | float | Model confidence (0-1) |
| `score` | float \| null | Numeric score (scored judges only) |
| `score_min` | float \| null | Minimum possible score |
| `score_max` | float \| null | Maximum possible score |
| `pass_threshold` | float \| null | Score required to pass |
| `model_used` | string | LLM model that ran the evaluation |
| `created_at` | string | ISO 8601 timestamp |

## Pagination example

For large result sets, paginate through all evaluations:

```python
all_evaluations = []
offset = 0
limit = 100

while True:
    response = ze.get_behavior_evaluations(
        project_id="your-project-id",
        judge_id="your-judge-id",
        limit=limit,
        offset=offset,
    )
    
    all_evaluations.extend(response["evaluations"])
    
    if len(response["evaluations"]) < limit:
        break
    
    offset += limit

print(f"Fetched {len(all_evaluations)} total evaluations")
```
